Use Transmitter.m and upload your image (locate your image path) where you want to hide the audio (locate your audio file similarly)
Save the Modified image (which holds the audio inside it)
Use Receiver.m to recover the audio from inside the image
Use other scripts like audiodenoising.m, audioanalysis.m, etc for further functionalities.
